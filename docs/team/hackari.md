### Project: NUSConnect

NUSConnect is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **UI color design**: Overhauled theme from base project, AB3, to better fit NUSConnect's aesthetic with the National University of Singapore.

* **Project management**:

    * Allocated tasks to group members for each milestone.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Delete: Added functionality to delete multiple people at once.
  * Regular Expression Matching: Wrote code and tests to test validity of newly added fields.
