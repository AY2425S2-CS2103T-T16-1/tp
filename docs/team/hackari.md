### Project: NUSConnect

NUSConnect is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
NUSConnect - It helps NUS students efficiently organise and manage the contact details of peers they meet during
tutorials and group projects. It is designed for users who prefer a CLI. It allows for custom labeling, reminders, easy
