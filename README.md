* This is **an address book** developed for NUS students.<br>
  Example usages:
  * organise contacts from lectures, tutorials, and CCAs
  * keep track of module-specific project teams and study groups
* The project provides an application (called _NUSConnect_) designed specifically for NUS students to manage their academic and personal contacts.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see **[NUSConnect Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t16-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
